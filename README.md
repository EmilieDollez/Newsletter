## My process

### Built with

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - I haven't use preformated component, only Tailwind classNames and custom CSS properties
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library


### What I learned

I was able to deepen my knowledge of Tailwind CSS classes and work on the use of React's UseStates.
I had started with the Desktop version and I realized that starting with the mobile version is essential. 
It's easier to make elements larger than to shrink them.ðŸ˜… I will apply this essential rule on my next projects.ðŸ˜œ


### Continued development

I would like to rework the project in a few months to optimize my code. 
The idea would be to use Redux to create a Store and make switching from States easier.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
